We at Programmers Club Chandigarh have [decided to make a small study-group to brush up our Algorithms and Data Structures](https://programmers-club-chandigarh.github.io/2016/11/06/meetup-summary.html). This repository is the collection of all the decisions we make, notes we take, and for central form communication that we fear gets trampled in all the talking in the [slack group](https://pcchd-slack.herokuapp.com/).



## Course to follow

We are following [MIT's 6-006 Fall 2011 course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm). Course videos are also available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) if you are the type who like downloading things.

## Weekly meetups

Since all present members of this small study group live in close proximity, we have decided to meet weekly to share our progress, discuss problems and keep everyone's spirits up. Weekly meetups are held in *Mohali* on weekdays, starting at around 7pm. We are a very small group, so everyone's presence is must. So we plan to have the meetup on Monday evening, and are flexible to postpone it until Friday if anyone can't make it.

Instead of keeping the meetings' topic vague discussions, we have decided to have one of the members give a small presentation/talk of what they learned. This member act as a mentor for that one meeting and is supposed to cover the day's topics better than others.
